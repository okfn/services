        <p>The CKAN workshop was outstanding. Our team grasped most of the inner workings of the platform by the first hour. There were so many code snippets and demos tailored to our goals that we even solved most of our roadmap by the end of the training. We are eager to start hacking CKAN - expect some pull requests!</p>

        <p>The Data Wrangling in One Day training helped more team members understand the definitions of open data; how to scrape data; and how to visualise it. It helped build their confidence in understanding technical terms and using different datasets. I anticipate that they will be more self-sufficient in accessing and using data and understanding what we are asking organisations to do when we ask them to open up their aid information. </p>
